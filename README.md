# DAO-Venture

## Introduction

DAO-Venture is an innovative, community-driven roguelite adventure game built and maintained by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Set in an ancient fantasy world filled with mysterious ruins, magical creatures, and forgotten lore, DAO-Venture offers a unique gaming experience that combines elements of text-based adventures, simple pixel art visuals, and strategic decision-making.

Key Features:

- Text-based adventure with simple pixel art visuals for each scenario
- Linear progression through randomized scenarios specific to each section
- FTL-inspired decision-making and progression system
- Simple combat with a randomized subset of abilities to choose each turn
- Multiple themed sections (e.g., Enchanted Forest, Ancient Ruins, Mystic Caves)
- Character development through unlockable races, classes, traits, and items
- DAO-managed game development and token distribution
- NFT integration for achievements and milestones

Players navigate through diverse areas, overcoming challenges and making critical decisions to reach the Forgotten Citadel. In this final area, they face ultimate trials and make choices that reshape the game world.
